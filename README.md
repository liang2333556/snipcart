![vuejs-ecommerce-snipcart-buttercms](https://snipcart.com/media/203610/vuejs-ecommerce-buttercms-snipcart.jpg)

There's a plethora of cool frameworks/ tools out there. Why not create a custom, kick*ss shopping experience with these?

Here, I want to use Vue.js to show you that's possible. Because yeah, Vue.js e-commerce is a thing!

And with the right set up in the backend—headless content management, namely— it can be a darn cool thing.

Steps:

- Create a neat, frontend Vue storefront
- Integrate a customizable HTML/JS cart in a Vue app
- Hook the Vue e-comm. app with headless ButterCMS
